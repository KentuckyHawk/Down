# Down Site
This website was created due to the fact that I accidentally let my payment for the domain lapse. So I needed a temporary page to redirect people. As the domain was down and this was at the time before, we fully 100% switched over from starlightgaming.network to starlightcommunity.network

## Why is it here insted of [@Starlight-Community-Network](https://github.com/Starlight-Community-Network)?
Mostly cause I removed the old domain from the org proflie ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
